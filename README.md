We model Coulomb interactions in the BLG using the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) theory [#Barlas2008, #ezawa2013quantum] and the Hartree-Fock approximation. We also consider
asymmetric interactions that describe the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the presence of isospin anisotropy [#Kharitonov2012a, #Kharitonov2012b, #Lee2014],
regularization due to the infinitely deep sea of occupied states [#Shizuya2011, #Shizuya2012, #Shizuya2020a], Zeeman interaction, and an external electric field. Finally, we find
energy levels for the three degrees of freedom, Landau level, valley, and spin, self-consistently with the screening factor and asymmetric interaction couplings as the only
adjustable parameters.

Results will be added to the results folder with a current date. Change the parameters.py file to the parameters you wish and run main.py for a default filling factor nu or
execute_main to run all relevant filling factors. Change the number of cores you want to use for the computations in the config.py file.

More instructions and descriptions will come soon.
