The exceptional electronic properties of bilayer graphene, such as massive chiral quasiparticles that create an octet of closely spaced energy levels under magnetic quantization, make it a prime candidate for exploring and testing models for interactions in this system. We employ the C2DEG theory to incorporate Coulomb interactions within the mean-field Hartree-Fock approximation. Additionally, we consider asymmetric interactions to characterize electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the presence of isospin anisotropy, regularization due to the infinitely deep sea of filled states, Zeeman interaction, and an external electric field. The energy levels are obtained self-consistently, using the screening factor and asymmetric interaction couplings as the adjustable parameters. Our predictions demonstrate excellent consistency and good quantitative agreement with recent experimental observations.
