We calculate the transition energies between Landau levels in bilayer graphene. Using the four-band SWMc model with a magnetic field to calculate single-particle physics non-perturbatively to incorporate warping effects, we consider the energy asymmetry $\Delta'$ and interlayer couplings $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{4},\text{ and},\gamma_{3}$. We report a quantitative description of all Landau level indices involved in cyclotron resonance in better agreement than previews effective lower-band model.
Moreover, we utilize the C2DEG theory to model Coulomb interactions in the bilayer graphene, employing the mean field Hartree-Fock approximation. We also account for asymmetric interactions to describe electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the presence of isospin anisotropy, as well as regularization due to the infinitely deep sea of filled states, Zeeman interaction, and an external electric field.
We obtain energy bands self-consistently, using the screening factor and asymmetric interaction couplings (for $\nu=0$) as the adjustable parameters.
